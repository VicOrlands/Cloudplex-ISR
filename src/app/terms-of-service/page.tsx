            <p>
                These terms and conditions (&quot;Agreement&quot;) set
                forth the general terms and conditions of your use of the
                CloudPlexo website (&quot;Website&quot; or
                &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and
                services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;). This
                Agreement is legally binding between you
                (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;)
                and CloudPlexo (&quot;CloudPlexo&quot;, &quot;we&quot;,
                &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using
                the Website and Services, you acknowledge that you have
                read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of
                this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on
                behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
                that you have the authority to bind such entity to this
                Agreement, in which case the terms &quot;User&quot;,
                &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; shall refer to such
                entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do
                not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not
                accept this Agreement and may not access and use the
                Website and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement
                is a contract between you and CloudPlexo, even though it
                is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
                governs your use of the Website and Services.
            </p>
            <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
            <p>
                You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Website
                and Services. By using the Website and Services and by
                agreeing to this Agreement you warrant and represent that
                you are at least 16 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you create an account on the Website, you are
                responsible for maintaining the security of your account
                and you are fully responsible for all activities that
                occur under the account and any other actions taken in
                connection with it. We may, but have no obligation to,
                monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and
                start using the Services. Providing false contact
                information of any kind may result in the termination of
                your account. You must immediately notify us of any
                unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
                security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions
                by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a
                result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable,
                or delete your account (or any part thereof) if we
                determine that you have violated any provision of this
                Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to
                damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your
                account for the foregoing reasons, you may not re-register
                for our Services. We may block your email address and
                Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.
            </p>
            <h2>Billing and payments</h2>
            <p>
                You shall pay all fees or charges to your account in
                accordance with the fees, charges, and billing terms in
                effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable.
                Where Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment
                may be required after the free trial period ends, and not
                when you enter your billing details (which may be required
                prior to the commencement of the free trial period). If
                auto-renewal is enabled for the Services you have
                subscribed for, you will be charged automatically in
                accordance with the term you selected. If, in our
                judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk
                transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy
                of your valid government-issued photo identification, and
                possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit
                or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right
                to change products and product pricing at any time. We
                also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with
                us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel
                quantities purchased per person, per household or per
                order. These restrictions may include orders placed by or
                under the same customer account, the same credit card,
                and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping
                address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel
                an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the
                e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the
                time the order was made.
            </p>
            <h2>Accuracy of information</h2>
            <p>
                Occasionally there may be information on the Website that
                contains typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions
                that may relate to promotions and offers. We reserve the
                right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions,
                and to change or update information or cancel orders if
                any information on the Website or Services is inaccurate
                at any time without prior notice (including after you have
                submitted your order). We undertake no obligation to
                update, amend or clarify information on the Website
                including, without limitation, pricing information, except
                as required by law. No specified update or refresh date
                applied on the Website should be taken to indicate that
                all information on the Website or Services has been
                modified or updated.
            </p>
            <h2>Uptime guarantee</h2>
            <p>
                We offer a Service uptime guarantee of 99% of available
                time per month. If we fail to maintain this service uptime
                guarantee in a particular month (as solely determined by
                us), you may contact us and request a credit off your
                Service fee for that month. The credit may be used only
                for the purchase of further products and services from us,
                and is exclusive of any applicable taxes. The service
                uptime guarantee does not apply to service interruptions
                caused by: (1) periodic scheduled maintenance or repairs
                we may undertake from time to time; (2) interruptions
                caused by you or your activities; (3) outages that do not
                affect core Service functionality; (4) causes beyond our
                control or that are not reasonably foreseeable; and (5)
                outages related to the reliability of certain programming
                environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although the Website and Services may link to other
                resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.),
                we are not, directly or indirectly, implying any approval,
                association, sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with
                any linked resource, unless specifically stated herein. We
                are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do
                not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or
                individuals or the content of their resources. We do not
                assume any responsibility or liability for the actions,
                products, services, and content of any other third
                parties. You should carefully review the legal statements
                and other conditions of use of any resource which you
                access through a link on the Website and Services. Your
                linking to any other off-site resources is at your own
                risk.
            </p>
            <h2>Prohibited uses</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no
                event will CloudPlexo, its affiliates, directors,
                officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be
                liable to any person for any indirect, incidental,
                special, punitive, cover or consequential damages
                (including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,
                revenue, sales, goodwill, use of content, impact on
                business, business interruption, loss of anticipated
                savings, loss of business opportunity) however caused,
                under any theory of liability, including, without
                limitation, contract, tort, warranty, breach of statutory
                duty, negligence or otherwise, even if the liable party
                has been advised as to the possibility of such damages or
                could have foreseen such damages. To the maximum extent
                permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of
                CloudPlexo and its affiliates, officers, employees,
                agents, suppliers and licensors relating to the services
                will be limited to an amount greater of one pound or any
                amounts actually paid in cash by you to CloudPlexo for the
                prior one month period prior to the first event or
                occurrence giving rise to such liability. The limitations
                and exclusions also apply if this remedy does not fully
                compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential
                purpose.
            </p>
            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
                You agree to indemnify and hold CloudPlexo and its
                affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
                suppliers and licensors harmless from and against any
                liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including
                reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with or
                arising from any third party allegations, claims, actions,
                disputes, or demands asserted against any of them as a
                result of or relating to your Content, your use of the
                Website and Services or any willful misconduct on your
                part.
            </p>
            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>
                All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement
                may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only
                to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws
                and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so
                that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid
                or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any
                provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal,
                invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
                jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the
                remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute
                their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof,
                and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof
                shall remain in full force and effect.

            <p>
                The formation, interpretation, and performance of this
                Agreement and any disputes arising out of it shall be
                governed by the substantive and procedural laws of United
                Kingdom without regard to its rules on conflicts or choice
                of law and, to the extent applicable, the laws of United
                Kingdom. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions
                related to the subject matter hereof shall be the courts
                located in United Kingdom, and you hereby submit to the
                personal jurisdiction of such courts. You hereby waive any
                right to a jury trial in any proceeding arising out of or
                related to this Agreement. The United Nations Convention
                on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not
                apply to this Agreement.

            <p>
                You may not assign, resell, sub-license or otherwise
                transfer or delegate any of your rights or obligations
                hereunder, in whole or in part, without our prior written
                consent, which consent shall be at our own sole discretion

                substantially all of its assets or stock or as part of a
                merger.
