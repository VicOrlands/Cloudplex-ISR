          <br />

          <p>
            <br />
            Enterprise businesses do not want to experience a downtime
            in the delivery of their online digital-based services,
            especially at a time when significant business operations
            are being carried out remotely and over the cloud.
            Majority of downtimes are not caused by cloud
            infrastructure faults but by customersâ€™ workloads which
            are exceeding their allocated resource limits, this can
            affect storage, processing and network resources.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is recommended not to quickly expand your cloud
            subscription plan to accommodate increasing workloads as
            it may surprise you to know that up to 40% of your cloud
            resource usage is idle and underutilized.
            <br />
            <br />
            Limits monitoring on the CloudPlexo platform is an
            efficient management offering that enables cloud users to
            stay in charge of their resource limits or quotas,
            completely avoiding downtime from service limit quotas
            threshold and unnecessary spending on subscription
            upgrades.
            <br />
            <br />
            CloudPlexo is providing its AWS cloud customers with a
            personalized solution that helps them proactively track
            resource usage and get notifications when approaching set
            usage thresholds, leveraging the AWS Trusted Advisor, a
            managed service that enables optimal AWS Infrastructure
            management including support for monitoring service limits
            or quotas.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Benefits of Monitoring AWS Service Limits with CloudPlexo
          </h4>
          <p>
            Here are highlights of the benefits of monitoring service
            limits with CloudPlexo;
          </p>
          <h5>Proactive Management</h5>
          <p>
            Keeping track of resource usage through the CloudPlexo
            platform will enable you to proactively attend to issues
            of concern before they get out of hand, thus keeping
            management teams abreast of consumption rate in relation
            to changes in workloads.
          </p>
          <h5>Operational Efficiency</h5>
          <p>
            Considering the critical nature of cloud-based business
            operations, monitoring service usage will help cloud users
            in ensuring that workloads are functioning as expected,
            efficiently and optimally.
          </p>
          <h5>Increased Availability</h5>
          <p>
            Monitoring service limits or quotas with the CloudPlexo
            platform is the best way of increasing the availability of
            your cloud services, as it will provide you with prompt
            notifications and reports on resource usage before it
            leads to downtime or other forms of service disruptions.
          </p>

          <h5>Cost Optimization</h5>

          <p>
            Combining the service limits monitoring and rightsizing
            capabilities on the CloudPlexo platform will yield
            optimized results for cost management, as users can easily
            and promptly analyze their workloads for improved
            efficiency in relation to cost of operations.
          </p>

          <h5>Prompt Planning</h5>

          <p>
            The delivery of a prompt resource usage report will enable
            management teams to properly plan their deployments in
            connection to expenditures, budgeting, optimization, and
            to further align with best practices.
