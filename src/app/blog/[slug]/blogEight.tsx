        <p>
          Although cloud cost optimization procedures are targeted
          at cutting down cloud expenses, it is however not expected
          to compromise the quality of resource operations. Hence,
          the overall goal of cloud cost optimization is to ensure
          that business and technical goals or objectives are
          attained and sustained through cost-efficiency.
          <br />
          <br />
          As organizations migrate their workloads to public cloud
          infrastructures such as AWS, it is important that they
          maintain their business and technical objectives at no
          extra budget-straining cost. However, this is quite
          difficult when in-house teams don’t have the time or
          expertise to monitor and optimally manage cloud resources
          in relation to costs and performance.
          <br />
          <br />
          As an AWS Partner, Cloudplexo can ensure that such
          organizations seamlessly and continuously leverage AWS
          scalability, performance and cost optimization
          opportunities while maintaining their ongoing business and
          technical objectives. To leverage AWS cost optimization
          opportunities, the following processes are essential,
          backed by combinations of AWS native tools and advanced
          solutions provided by Cloudplexo.
        </p>
        <h5>Dependency Mapping and Analysis</h5>
        <p>
          Taking Inventory of all software assets on your cloud
          environment is the first step to gaining control and
          understanding the cost and operational effects of all
          applications. Using advanced management tools such as
          Cloudplexo, the established inventory can be analyzed to
          gain clearer visibility on performance, security to
          further map and assess dependent applications or services.
        </p>
        <h5>AWS Best Practices</h5>
        <p>
          AWS provides cloud management recommendations that are
          considered as the 5 pillars of best practices. Delivered
          through the AWS Well-Architected platform on Cloudplexo,
          these recommendations are being provided to help cloud
          architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and
          efficient infrastructure for their applications and
          workloads which will lead to cost optimization.
        </p>
        <h5>Workload Rightsizing</h5>
        <p>
          Workload rightsizing involves matching organization’s
          applications with the allotted resources or instance type.
          This will ensure that cloud users are not wasting money
          due to over-provisioning or placing performance at risk
          due to under-provisioning of resources. For autonomous
          management, AI-powered solutions such as Cloudplexo
          further provide factored recommendations such as
          reservation of EC2 instances which can result in huge
          savings when compared to OnDemand pricing.
        </p>
        <h5>Automated Resource Scheduling</h5>
        <p>
          Non-production resources including those for development
          or staging environment can build up cloud bills when they
          are not in use. Hence, it is essential to schedule their
          availability or active modes only to peak or needed
          periods, using flexible automated tools as provided for
          AWS workloads through Cloudplexo.
        </p>

        <h5>Distributed Disaster Management</h5>
        <p>
          Disaster management is significantly easier and precise on
          cloud-native applications due to its distributed nature
          enabled by containerization.
        </p>

        <h5> Intelligent Forecasting</h5>
        <p>
          As the organization plans for its business or technical
          expansion, smart cost management platforms can make the
          cloud cost budget or forecast to be realistic and
          data-driven, enabling teams to easily take decisions.
