                <br />
                <p>Cloudplexo has achieved the AWS Small and Medium Business (SMB) Competency status. While we're thrilled about adding another badge to our collection, we're even more excited about what this means for businesses like yours.</p>
                <p>Let's start with the basics: AWS (Amazon Web Services) has officially recognized CloudPlexo as experts in helping small and medium-sized businesses succeed in the cloud. Think of it as AWS saying, "These folks really know their stuff when it comes to helping SMBs!"</p>

                <h5>What AWS SMB Competency Means for African Businesses</h5>
                <ol>

                        <br />
                        Remember trying on a "one-size-fits-all" piece of clothing? It rarely fits perfectly, right? The same goes for cloud solutions. What works for a giant corporation might not be the best fit for your growing business.
