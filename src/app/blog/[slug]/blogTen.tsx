            Digital Transformation
          </span>
          <br />A successful digital transformation implementation
          should result in the organization having a clear vision
          and purpose - one that serves their customers, partners,
          and employees. Digital transformation is different to
          Digitization or digitalization. They all leverage on
          people and technology but are independent concept.
        </p>

        <p>
          In lay term, Digital transformation means using technology
          to optimize the ways of doing business to drive growth in
          new and existing markets, of course this could mean
          something different for other organization, but the core
          factor to consider in digital transformation are:
        </p>

        <p>
          Re-invention, Re-alignment, Renewal of business models/
          operation through leveraging technology (tools,
          application, methodology or concept), people skills and
          competencies to drive better business result and
          performance that will benefit the organization, the
          customer and the market.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>Digitization</span>,
          basically, is the process of conversion of information
          embedded in physical documents, from analog to digital. It
          ensures such information can have wider reach, readily
          accessible, compatibility and easily shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>Digitalization</span>{" "}
          is the process of using digitized information to work more
          simply, efficiently, and stay agile.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span style={{ fontWeight: "800" }}>Cloud Computing</span>{" "}
          is an internet-based computing where central remote
          servers maintain all the data and applications. It allows
          Consumers to rent physical infrastructure from a third
          party provider (cloud service provider, like AWS). As a
          result, with internet access Consumers and Businesses use
          Applications and Infrastructure and access their personal
          files from any computer. It provides a number of IT
          services like networking, software, server among the
          others.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have to pay only for your usage instead of paying
          upfront ( pay-per –use basis). Your all data is stored in
          your servers and all the servers are located at the place
          called Data Center which can be owned and maintained by a
          third party or you.

          designers, and project managers from Africa to UK
          technology companies. They had a really huge problem;
          their team at Geria was unable to manage the process of
          their cloud environment and infrastructure in order to
          discover areas cloud optimization can be applied to reduce
          spend. This set them on a search for a high-level
          management tool to help manage their cloud environment.
          Thankfully, they found CloudPlexo. We provided them CMP,
