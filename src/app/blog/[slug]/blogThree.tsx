        <p>
          The introduction of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
          opened the cloud computing world to enterprises of all
          sizes with the provision of scalability coupled with a
          pay-per-use model. However, lots of IaaS customers or
          users are not optimally leveraging the cost benefits of
          thes ervice model.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since Small-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) now have access to
          cloud computing through IaaS just like Large Enterprises,
          other related services such as cloud cost management tools
          are therefore also available to SMEs for the optimization
          of theircloud operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combining cloud cost management tools with an
          Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) software helps
          enterprises to have better control of their cloud
          services-related expenditures, havingresource usage/demand
          insights and predictive analyticsto drive cost reduction.
        </p>

        <p>
          An Ideal cloud cost management tools such as the{" "}
          <Link href="https://cloudplexo.com/">Cloudplexo platform</Link>{" "}
          provides SMEs with unlimited opportunities to cut-down
          their cloud operational cost by leveraging the following
          features which are offered on the platform:
        </p>

        <h5>Resource Usage Monitoring</h5>

        <p>
          Adopting a cloud cost management tool enables enterprises
          to have a clearer insight of their service consumption and
          presents the corresponding financial impact on a real-time
          basis. Predictive analytics are also provided by making
          optimal use of the data gathered during resource usage
          monitoring, which further gives the tool users the ability
          to closely and quickly make knowledge-driven decisions.
        </p>

        <h5>Operations Scheduling</h5>
        <p>
          Why do you have to pay for cloud services that are running
          at periods when they are not needed? This is like paying
          for completely idle job hours
        </p>

        <p>
          Witha cloud cost management tool, users can configure
          operational schedules to start and stop depending on work
          loads and work hours. This can also apply to projects and
          deployments where their environments are required to run
          onlyfor specific periods.
        </p>

        <h5>Rightsizing recommendation</h5>
        <p>
          The aim of providing rightsizing recommendations is to
          help users to promptly identify optimization opportunities
          and resource under utilization. Achieving maximum
          performance at the lowest possible costs is the goal of
          rightsizing cloud resources. While it is difficult to
          manually attain maximum balance between workloads and
          allocated resources, an ideal cloud cost management tool
          can automatically provide such recommendations more
          accurately and promptly.
        </p>

        <h5>User-Friendly Data Representation</h5>
        <p>
          It is not enough to generate resource usage data, as a
          visually appealing and easy-to-use presentation will
          communicate more meaning to the users. Just as itâ€™s seen
          on the{" "}
          <Link href="https://cloudplexo.com/">Cloudplexo platform</Link>{" "}
          dashboard, a user-friendly interface/experience will
          enable efficiency and remove the complexity in managing
          cloud operation expenditures.
        </p>

        <h5>Multi-Cloud Support</h5>
        <p>
          The ability to have a cost management tool that supports
          integration with different clouds is an additional
          advantage, improving flexibility and optimizing cost to
          the most efficient level across varying scales or sizes of
          cloud operations.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, cloud cost optimization is best achieved
          with the right tools in place. More interestingly is the
          fact that these tools are not limited to just hyper or
          large scale cloud users but also available to SMEs, thus
          enabling a high levelof scalability and flexibility.
