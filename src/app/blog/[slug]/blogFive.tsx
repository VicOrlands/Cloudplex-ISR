        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Building a cloud-native company, firm, business or
          organization implies leveraging the full potential of the
          cloud to build and run loosely coupled systems that are
          resilient, manageable, and observable.
          <br />
          <br />
          Migrating digital operations and resources from
          traditional servers or hosting services to a cloud
          infrastructure can directly translate to changing
          environments but not changing behaviors or practices.
          Therefore, cloud users with non-cloud-native digital
          operations and resources such as softwares are only
          capable of accessing the most basic and generic offerings
          of the cloud which is not far from what a traditional data
          infrastructure offers.
          <br />
          <br />
          The need to build a cloud-native company, firm, business
          or organization is as important as the choice of migrating
          to the cloud, as this provides first-hand access to
          broader and operation-aligned capabilities within private,
          public or hybrid cloud environments. Here are some of the
          underlying benefits or potentials of building a company
          whose operations are significantly cloud-native
        </p>
        <h5>Micro-Scalability</h5>
        <p>
          Developing and running loosely coupled systems are typical
          techniques that enable quasi-independent life-cycle of
          each system component through the use of cloud containers,
          a process also known as containerization. With this
          capability, a cloud-native company can scale specific
          system components based on demands or operational
          requirements without the need to scale the entire system,
          thereby optimizing the dynamic resource allocation
          potential of the cloud to benefit the company and its
          customers as well as increase the efficiency rate of the
          cloud infrastructure. For example, CloudPlexo cost
          management platform incorporates right-sizing
          recommendations to reduce inefficient usage of oversized
          cloud resources.
        </p>
        <h5>Faster Release/Delivery of Product and Services</h5>
        <p>
          The ability to modify or develop only selected components
          of a system or subsystems based on demands or requirements
          gives a cloud-native company the power to enviably
          implement or deliver new products and services in a
          shorter time as only the component or subsystem will be
          developed or modified with no fear of breaking the entire
          system.
        </p>
        <h5>Smart/Responsive Experience</h5>
        <p>
          The word “smart” now has market places and if a company is
          built with a cloud-native architecture, its products and
          services can easily get a significant share of such
          markets. As seen with the outbreak COVID 19, the needs of
          digital services and products users became concentrated on
          certain offerings such as ecommerce, news, health,
          teleconferencing, and remote work application services. In
          a case where any of these services are parts of a
          cloud-native company system, resource allocation can be
          automatically modified for the particular service to meet
          the spike in traffic and efficiently manage emergencies.
          Smart solutions are not just expected to meet the dynamic
          needs of users but also to meet the dynamic
          infrastructural and financial strength of the provider as
          well as the ever-changing managerial operations of the
          firm.
        </p>
        <h5>Optimized Security</h5>
        <p>
          There are specific attack techniques for specific digital
          operations and as such, there is a need to provide
          specialised security for each service to enable
          reliability and advanced resiliency in cyberspace.
          Companies with cloud-native systems can achieve this level
          of security more efficiently and faster.
        </p>

        <h5>Distributed Disaster Management</h5>
        <p>
          Disaster management is significantly easier and precise on
          cloud-native applications due to its distributed nature
          enabled by containerization.
        </p>

        <h5>Easy Automation</h5>
        <p>
          With the recent breakthroughs in AIOps, cloud users are
          eager to hop on advanced automation solutions. However,
          only cloud-native companies are exposed to the ultimate
          offerings of these automation technologies.
        </p>

        <h5>Cost Optimization</h5>

        <p>
          The first opportunity the cloud provides is cost-efficient
          scalability and of what use is migrating to the cloud and
          still spending more than other cloud users? Hence,
          transform your company to a cloud-native one and enjoy the
          extra savings on cost of operations. Cloud management
          platforms such as CloudPlexo’s give users insight into
          current cloud spend as well as forecasted spending and
          cost reduction strategies. Overall, cloud-native companies
          have the potential to provide a faster, more secure and
          more efficient service for both users and developers.
          Businesses can leverage this opportunity to deliver the
          best to customers and clients and maintain the ability to
          be scalable, adaptable and agile.
