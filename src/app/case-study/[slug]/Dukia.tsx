              Dukia is a digital marketplace redefining the world of NFTs and
              digital ownership. It is an innovative and culturally oriented
              platform where users can surf, design, amass, sell, auction, and
              gift NFTs. Dukia places a high value on the security of its
              customers' digital assets. Creators can easily mint and sell NFTs
              with ultra-low fees while retaining ownership rights, and
              collectors can discover and purchase unique NFTs directly from
              creators on Dukia's user-friendly platform.

            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>
              Dukia sought to embark on a transformative journey to rearchitect
              its application infrastructure, transitioning from a monolithic
              model to a microservices architecture on AWS. This project aimed
              to elevate its cloud capabilities, enhancing scalability, agility,
              maintainability, and security using CloudPlexo's AWS Maturity
              Services.
