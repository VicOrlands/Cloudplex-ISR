## Introduction

In an era of evolving digital landscapes and stringent data residency requirements, financial institutions face the challenge of migrating on-premise workloads to cloud environments that comply with local regulations. This case study explores the successful migration of **GT Pensions Managers'** on-premise workloads to the **Lagos Local Zone**, enabling adherence to Nigerian data residency laws while improving scalability, security, and operational efficiency.

## Background

**GT Pensions Managers**, a leading Nigerian financial institution, specializes in managing pension funds and investments. To enhance data security and comply with local regulations, the company decided to migrate its infrastructure to the **AWS Lagos Local Zone**, ensuring customer data remains within Nigerian borders.
