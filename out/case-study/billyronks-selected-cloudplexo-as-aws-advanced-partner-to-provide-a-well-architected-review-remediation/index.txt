## Overview

BillyRonks Global Ltd, founded in 2018, is a global, dynamic, and trustworthy telecoms firm that provides key services such as Wholesale Carrier Services, Business and Retail Voice, Value Added Services, and more. BillyRonks Global Ltd has been internationally licensed and demonstrates expertise in the telecommunications business. BillyRonks' telecom network equipment, ICT products and solutions, and smart gadgets are among the most advanced technologies for delivering competitive connectivity services that keep customers ahead of the competition in the global telecommunications environment.
BillyRonks selected CloudPlexo as an AWS Advanced Partner to provide a Well-Architected Review & Remediation for their application running in AWS, with the objective of reducing costs and improving operations and security within their cloud environment.

## Customer Challenge

BillyRonks needed to implement best practices on cost optimization, security, and efficient operations in AWS. This required a specific skill set, prompting them to seek support from the AWS Partner Network.

## Partner Solution

CloudPlexo's SaaS solution—**Wendu Cloud Security and Management platform**—automates the well-architected assessment for the customer with in-depth drill-downs on cost and security, in collaboration with certified CloudPlexo Solutions Architects.
CloudPlexo is an AWS partner enrolled in the AWS Well-Architected Partner Program, which demonstrates CloudPlexo's expertise in performing Well-Architected Reviews.

## What is a Well-Architected Review (WAR)?

A Well-Architected Review (WAR) is a process developed by AWS to enable cloud architects to build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for applications. The WAR is designed to assess a cloud workload against AWS's best practices and identify tasks to improve the AWS workload within one of the following six pillars:

* Operational Excellence Pillar
* Security Pillar
* Reliability Pillar
* Performance Efficiency Pillar
* Cost Optimization Pillar
* Sustainability Pillar

A Well-Architected Review consists of two steps:

1. Review
2. Remediate

The ultimate objective is to enhance the AWS environment where application workloads run across one or more key WAR pillars, aiming for a scenario where the workload environment is configured following AWS Best Practices.

## Results and Benefits

During the CloudPlexo review, in collaboration with BillyRonks, the workload environment was assessed. The review yielded a set of actions, which were then prioritized and deliberated upon with BillyRonks, leading to the formulation of a systematic plan to enhance the AWS environment.
Throughout the remediation phase of the WAR process, the list of actions was addressed, discussed, documented, and executed. This resulted in improvements to the AWS applications across all six WAR pillars.2:["$","$Le",null,{"caseStudy":{"content":"$f","date":"2023-11-08","published":true,"tablename":"cloudplexo-cms-casestudies","slug":"billyronks-selected-cloudplexo-as-aws-advanced-partner-to-provide-a-well-architected-review-remediation","tag":"Telecommunications","description":"BillyRonks Global Ltd, established in 2018, is a global telecoms firm offering Wholesale Carrier Services, Business and Retail Voice, Value Added Services, and more.","key":"billyronks-selected-cloudplexo-as-aws-advanced-partner-to-provide-a-well-architected-review-remediation","thumbnail":"https://cloudplexo-cms-bucket.s3.af-south-1.amazonaws.com/case-studies/billyronks-selected-cloudplexo-as-aws-advanced-partner-to-provide-a-well-architected-review-remediation/1732802735738-billyronks.webp","author":"CloudPlexo Team","title":"BillyRonks selected CloudPlexo as AWS Advanced partner to provide a Well Architected Review & Remediation"}}]
