- Click "Next."

#### Step 4: Configure Build Settings

1. Define your build settings:
   - Select the framework or environment of your app (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).
   - Configure the build settings like build commands, output directory, etc.
2. Click "Next."

> Framework and build settings can be auto detected, this steps can be skipped if it does.

Also, if you require a custom build setting, In your project root, you can add a `amplify.yml` where your can have something like this:

```yml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: out
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

#### Step 5: Review and Deploy

- Follow the instructions to add and configure your custom domain.

#### Step 9: Continuous Deployment (Optional)

AWS Amplify supports continuous deployment, allowing automatic updates whenever you push changes to your repository:

- Enable the "Continuous deployment" option in the Amplify Console.
- Choose the branch to monitor for changes.
- Any new commits to that branch will trigger automatic redeployment.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and hosted your web app on AWS Amplify. Remember to manage your app settings and monitor its performance regularly through the Amplify Console.
