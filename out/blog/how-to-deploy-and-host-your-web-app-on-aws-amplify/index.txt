- Click "Next."

#### Step 4: Configure Build Settings

1. Define your build settings:
   - Select the framework or environment of your app (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).
   - Configure the build settings like build commands, output directory, etc.
2. Click "Next."

> Framework and build settings can be auto detected, this steps can be skipped if it does.

Also, if you require a custom build setting, In your project root, you can add a `amplify.yml` where your can have something like this:

```yml
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: out
    files:
      - "**/*"
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

#### Step 5: Review and Deploy

- Follow the instructions to add and configure your custom domain.

#### Step 9: Continuous Deployment (Optional)

AWS Amplify supports continuous deployment, allowing automatic updates whenever you push changes to your repository:

- Enable the "Continuous deployment" option in the Amplify Console.
- Choose the branch to monitor for changes.
- Any new commits to that branch will trigger automatic redeployment.
