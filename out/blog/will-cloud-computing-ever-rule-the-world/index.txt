f:T1482,## Introduction

Before we dive into the topic for today’s blog post, let us, first, have a recap into what cloud computing is. I like to define cloud computing as simple as computing, but on the cloud. So, it’s every bit of computing you can do with a physical computer, operating system, application, database or server on a grander, larger and faster scale.That is management, processing and communication of information in a grander, larger and faster scale than ever imagined.

Not to get into why cloud computing is important in today’s world–be it in our everyday lives with IoT, or in business with the analytics power, or even in sports with the ability to get and analyse real time data, space technology, health and life sciences, the list goes on; cloud computing has proven to be the bedrock of innovation in today’s society.

### Cloud Computing vs Cloud Storage

Now, so we’re on the same page here and we have a defined scope for this blog post, we’ll clearly define and give the difference between what cloud storage is and what cloud computing is.

#### Cloud Storage

In a nutshell, cloud storage is the ability to store data on servers running on data centres, which is mostly owned and managed by Cloud Storage Providers and is accessible to you, the owner of this data, anywhere in the world, and at any time of the day. For example, Amazon Drive, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive.

#### Cloud computing

Cloud computing, on the other hand, can be defined simply as the ability to process this data stored in the cloud for analytics, innovation or work collaboration. For example, Amazon Workspace, Google Docs, Photo Viewer App, Outlook Outline.

### The World Wide Web and the Global Village

Remember the revolution caused by the introduction of the World Wide Web in the early 90s, and how we still reap from the benefits the technology offers to our world. Of all the benefits that came with the launch of the World Wide Web, Globalisation was one effect that not many experts predicted will have the most impact on us. Globalisation of cultures which means beliefs, lifestyles, ideas all of a sudden was being exchanged at a grander, larger and faster scale that has brought about immense opportunities in business, education and lifestyle with fewer cultural and distance barriers–a global village indeed!

### Cloud Computing–the Globalisation of Data!

Now, take everything the internet has achieved through the World Wide Web technology, with the ability to send and receive information from anywhere in the world to make decisions and exchange that with the ability to compute using both real time and historical data from anywhere in the world to make decisions. The team scientist working on a life changing drug can work in real time, with real time data being managed, processed and communicated from different parts of the world! The team in China does not need to wait for the team in Africa to be done with computing and then send the results over to them for a next step of the process.

### Cloud Computing with Amazon Web Services

With analytic services like [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/?c=a\&sec=srv) for big data processing, [Amazon Kinetics](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/?c=a\&sec=srv) for interactive analysis and [Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/?c=a\&sec=srv) for operational analysis; and with predictive analytics and machine learning cloud services like [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/?c=a\&sec=srv), cloud computing really will rule the world as the globalisation of data and powerful cloud computing services such as these ones mentioned here become more and more important to the development of our society in every field of life that we can think of!
