This vision will serve as the north star for all your subsequent decisions."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Once your vision is clear, conduct a comprehensive inventory of your current applications, data, and infrastructure.

This thorough understanding of your current state is invaluable in planning your future AWS architecture."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"With your inventory complete, you can begin designing your AWS architecture. This stage involves careful consideration of various AWS services. You'll need to weigh compute options like EC2, Lambda, or ECS; storage solutions such as S3, EBS, or EFS; database services including RDS or DynamoDB; networking through VPC or Direct Connect; and security measures via IAM, WAF, or Shield.
